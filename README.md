# ProgressBarExample
This Project tells about how to work on progressbar<br>
A user interface element that indicates the progress of an operation. Progress bar supports two modes to represent progress: determinate, and indeterminate. For a visual overview of the difference between determinate and indeterminate progress modes, see Progress & activity. Display progress bars to a user in a non-interruptive way. Show the progress bar in your app's user interface or in a notification instead of within a dialog.
